            <h3>NeuraSys V2D2</h3>
            <h6>2024-09-27</h6>
            <p class="lead">We are honored to share the new version of NeuraSys with you. First of all, we added the "update" command, which lets you update your PC without reinstalling the whole operating system. Be aware, that this feature is still in BETA, and data loss and/or corruption MAY occur! Second of all, we reworked the "copy" command to be more efficient and added a progress bar too. The next modification is the "driveControl" command, which adds the ability to mount and eject ISOs/drives. We also moved the "listDrives" command into this menu. We had a lot of bugs with the "compress" command, so we decided to rewrite it from the ground up: We gave it new functionalities (E. g.: Being able to add folders to it) and also a progress bar. The last thing for today's update is a small change: from now on, commands are not case sensitive, meaning that you can type them however you want. We are glad we could fix some serious bugs and provide more and more improvements towards the software. Stay tuned for further updates or fixes! :)</p>

            <h3>NeuraSys V2D1</h3>
            <h6>2024-09-19</h6>
            <p class="lead">We are thrilled to share with you the new version of NeuraSys. For the second main version of NeuraSys we bring a lot of new features and bug fixes for you. Fist of all, we changed the "run" command: now it opens another CMD prompt for running applications, so you don't have to manually create a new window. Secondly, we added the "compress" command, which is the opposite of "extract": with it you can now add multiple files to a ZIP file, which then can be extracted again. The next we added was "uptime", which shows the amount of time the computer has been on. Our next new command is "setTime", which lets you change the time of the system. You can choose from manual or automatic calibritaion, but the automatic setting requires an Internet connection. We removed one command, the "createShortcut" one. We improved our "userAuth" system, now all the settings are stored in only one JSON file. We also changed an option in "userAuth", from now on the default group cannot be changed, instead the login page can be enabled or disabled. We hope, we could bring important updates and fixes for, and stay tuned for further updates!</p>

            <h3>NeuraSys V1D6 AF1</h3>
            <h6>2024-09-15</h6>
            <p class="lead">We are happy to share with you the new version of NeuraSys. We didn't have enough time to create a full update, but we fixed some bugs, translation errors, and even added new function! The first thing we added is the ability to change the monitor and/or computer timeout. This means, that after how many minutes does your screen fade or computer turns off. In addition, we replaced "laptopControl" with "controlPanel", and added these timeout settings there. We also added the ability to copy files from and to any drive (except C:\). We fixed a bug with task scheduler: now on laptops, by disabling "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" you can automatically launch application when the computer starts up. We hope we could add or fix some lacking features and stay tuned for other - hopefully - bigger updates.</p>

            <h3>NeuraSys V1D6</h3>
            <h6>2024-09-14</h6>
            <p class="lead">We are glad, that we can share today's new updates, we have a lot coming, so be prepared! This update concentrates on laptop users: we finally added the "wifi" command, which connects your device to the Internet. The next laptop-focused update is the "laptopControl" command, where you can adjust the brightness of the screen (works for most of the desktops too!) and check your battery status. In this update, we added the "setVolume" command, which let's you control your device's volume in percentages. We also removed the "startUp" command, which is being completely replaced by the "automation" command. In addition, we added the ability to extract files to any drive and to change to any drive (except C:\). We fixed some known bugs and translation errors too. We hope we could fix some problems, and stay tuned for further updates!</p>

            <h6>2024-09-09</h6>
            <p class="lead">We are thrilled to share the fifth version of NeuraSys. We are introducing quite a lot of modifications: We added the ability to logout from the current user account using the "logout" command. For better server usage, we've added two automation commands, "automation", which opens up task scheduler (default Windows one) and "startUp" which lets you add or remove files, that automatically startup when you start the system. We added a new "userAuth" option, now you can change permissions for existing groups. Last, but not least, we fixed many bugs and translation errors. We are working on the ability to open MP3/4 files and being able to use Wi-Fi, which is still in test phase. Stay tuned for these upcoming updates along with security and performance patches. </p>

We added a new commands, the "openPort" command, which lets you modify an either TCP or UDP port. We modified the "changeDir" command, from now on you can select removable or CD-ROM drives too. The "copy" command was also improved, now you can copy files from different drives too. We hope we could help you out with these modification and stay tuned for upcoming updates.</p>
